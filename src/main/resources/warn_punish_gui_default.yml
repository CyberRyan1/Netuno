  # <!> IMPORTANT <!>
  # <!> NEW PUNISHMENT CONFIG FORMAT <!>
  # Below is the NEW format for punishments in the GUI.
  # It is NOT backwards compatible with the old format.
  # We no longer support the old format used in 1.4.2-BETA or earlier.
  # Switching to this new format should be easy, though.

  # You can customize each punishment and add new punishments to suite your needs
  # To do so, just copy and paste the example format below, and remove the comments (hashtags)
  # Maximum of 18 punishments per GUI
  # The size of the GUI will be automatically calculated based off the indexes of the punishments
  # The index of the punishment is the key of the punishment in this config file
  #       For an image of all indexes in a GUI, see here: https://proxy.spigotmc.org/ca33289f0d69cf685454fd6d4843cd392b5572c3?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Flr41ykP.png
  # The reason for each punishment is the name of the item, without the colors
  #       Example: if the item name is "&eSpam", then the punishment reason is "Spam"
  # To remove a punishment item, set the material to AIR
  # Here's the format for a punishment:
  #  INDEX_HERE:
  #    item-name: "hi"
  #    item-lore: "something"
  #    item-material: GREEN_WOOL
  #    punish-after: 1
  #    punishment: mute
  #    starting-time: 30m
  #    autoscale: true

  inventory_name: "&a&lWARN &7[TARGET]"
  # Permission to open this GUI
  # Set to "" for no permission needed
  permission: ""

  # The index of the punishment item
  10:
    # Name of the item in the GUI
    item-name: "&eSpam"
    # Lore of the item in the GUI
    # Set to "" for no lore
    item-lore: "&7Offenses: &6[PREVIOUS]"
    # Material of the item in the GUI
    material: YELLOW_WOOL
    # How many warns until they get the next punishment
    # Ex: if you set this to 1, then they will be punished for the second offense and higher
    punish-after: 1
    # What the next punishment should be
    # Options: kick, mute, ban, ipmute, ipban
    punishment: mute
    # The starting time
    starting-time: 30m
    # Whether to autoscale the punishment length or not
    # For example, if you set the starting-time to 30m, the second warn will result in a 30 minute mute, the third mute will result in a 60 minute mute, and so on
    # For warns, the autoscale only applies to the punishment after the warn
    # (ex: the first punishment is a warn, the second punishment is a 30 minute mute, and the third punishment is also a 30 minute mute
