# This GUI is what you see when you click on the mute button in the punish GUI

  # <!> IMPORTANT- NEW PUNISHMENT CONFIG FORMAT <!>
  # Below is the NEW format for punishments in the GUI.
  # It is NOT backwards compatible with the old format.
  # Netuno no longer supports the old format used in 1.4.2-BETA or earlier.
  # Switching to this new format should be easy, though.

  # You can customize each punishment and add new punishments to suite your needs.
  # To do so, just copy and paste the example format below, and remove the comments (hashtags).
  # Maximum of 18 punishments per GUI.
  # The size of the GUI will be automatically calculated based off the indexes of the punishments.
  # The index of the punishment is the key of the punishment in this config file.
  # The reason for each punishment is the name of the item, without the colors.
  #       Example: if the item name is "&eSpam", then the punishment reason is "Spam"
  # To not display a punishment item, set the material to AIR.
  # Note that the format for a punishment in this GUI is different from the format of a punishment in the warn GUI.
  # Here's the format for a punishment (what each line means is explained in further below):
  #  INDEX_HERE:
  #    item-name: "hi"
  #    item-lore: "something"
  #    item-material: GREEN_WOOL
  #    starting-time: 30m
  #    autoscale: true
  #    instant-key: "hi_hello"

  # Name of the GUI
  # Note: you cannot use the [PREVIOUS] variable in the name of the inventory
  inventory_name: "&e&lMUTE &7[TARGET]"
  # Permission to open this GUI
  # Set to "" for no permission needed
  permission: ""

  # The index of the punishment item
  10:
    # Name of the item
    item-name: ""
    # Lore of the item
    # Set to "" for no lore
    item-lore: ""
    # Material of the item
    material: AIR
    # The starting time
    starting-time: 1m
    # Whether to autoscale the punishment length or not
    # For example, if you set the starting-time to 30m, the second warn will result in a 30 minute mute, the third mute will result in a 60 minute mute, and so on
    autoscale: true
    # If you have instant punishments enabled for the /punish command, this is the key
    #   that is used to reference this punishment
    instant-key: ""
