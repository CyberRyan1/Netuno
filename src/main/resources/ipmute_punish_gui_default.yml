########################################

# This GUI is what you see when you click on the IP mute button in the punish GUI

# Variables that can be used throughout this config file:
# [TARGET] = Player being punished
# [PREVIOUS] = Number of previous offenses the player has for a particular punishment

  # <!> IMPORTANT- NEW PUNISHMENT CONFIG FORMAT <!>
  # Below is the NEW format for punishments in the GUI.
  # It is NOT backwards compatible with the old format.
  # Netuno no longer supports the old format used in 1.4.2-BETA or earlier.
  # Switching to this new format should be easy, though.

  # You can customize each punishment and add new punishments to suite your needs.
  # To do so, just copy and paste the example format below, and remove the comments (hashtags).
  # Maximum of 18 punishments per GUI.
  # The size of the GUI will be automatically calculated based off the indexes of the punishments.
  # The index of the punishment is the key of the punishment in this config file.
  # The reason for each punishment is the name of the item, without the colors.
  #       Example: if the item name is "&eSpam", then the punishment reason is "Spam"
  # To not display a punishment item, set the material to AIR.
  # Note that the format for a punishment in this GUI is different from the format of a punishment in the warn GUI.
  # Here's the format for a punishment (what each line means is explained in further below):
  #  INDEX_HERE:
  #    item-name: "hi"
  #    item-lore: "something"
  #    item-material: GREEN_WOOL
  #    starting-time: 30m
  #    autoscale: true

  # Name of the GUI
  # Note: you cannot use the [PREVIOUS] variable in the name of the inventory
  inventory_name: "&c&lIPMUTE &7[TARGET]"
  # Permission to open this GUI
  # Set to "" for no permission needed
  permission: ""

  # Settings for the IP mute GUI
  settings:

    # When you use HIGHEST_MUTED_ALT as a starting time for a GUI punishment, the length of the IP mute can be one of two things:
    #    a) the length of the longest mute of the player's alts
    #    b) the length of the longest remaining mute of the player's alts
    #
    # Example for option a):
    #    Player A has 2 alts, Player B, who is muted for 1 day, and Player C, who is muted for 2 days.
    #    All accounts will be IP muted for 2 days, because the longest mute is from Player C, who is muted for 2 days.
    # Example for option b):
    #    Player A has 2 alts, Player B, who is muted for 1 day, and Player C, who is muted for 2 days.
    #    Player B has 12 hours remaining on their mute, and Player C has 6 hours remaining on their mute.
    #    All accounts will be IP muted for 12 hours, because the longest remaining mute is from Player B, who has 12 hours remaining on their mute.
    #
    # To use option a, set this to LENGTH_STANDARD.
    # To use option b, set this to LENGTH_REMAINING.
    highest-muted-alt-length: LENGTH_STANDARD

    # Similar to the highest-muted-alt-length setting above, but with bans instead of mutes
    # To use option a, set this to LENGTH_STANDARD.
    # To use option b, set this to LENGTH_REMAINING.
    highest-banned-alt-length: LENGTH_STANDARD

    # For the IP mute and IP ban GUIs, you can set this to "HIGHEST_MUTED_ALT" or "HIGHEST_BANNED_ALT"
    #   to get the highest length of a mute/ban an alt of the target has.
    #   HIGHEST_MUTED_ALT = highest length of a muted alt
    #   HIGHEST_BANNED_ALT = highest length of a banned alt
