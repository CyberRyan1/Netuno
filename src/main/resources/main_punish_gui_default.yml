  # Already Being Punished button replacement

  #     section for "playerOne", then the warn button will be replaced with this button

    # Available variables:
    #    [TYPE] = punishment type (e.g. "warned", "muted", etc.)
    #    [STAFF] = staff member who is currently punishing the target

    name: "" # Set to nothing to not replace the name of the button
    lore: "&cThis player is already being [TYPE] by [STAFF]" # Set to nothing for no lore on the item
